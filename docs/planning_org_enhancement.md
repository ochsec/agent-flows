Based on your current implementation and the features available in Claude Code, here are key areas to focus on to complete your planning and organization tools:
Core Planning Mode Enhancements
Your current planning mode implementation is a good start, but needs significant expansion to match Claude Code’s capabilities:
Enhanced Plan Structure
	•	Structured Planning Format: Implement numbered, hierarchical planning outputs with clear sections for goals, challenges, implementation steps, and success criteria
	•	Plan Validation: Add validation logic to ensure plans meet minimum quality standards before allowing exit from plan mode
	•	Plan Templates: Create templates for different types of projects (feature development, refactoring, debugging)
Interactive Planning Workflow

```python
def interactive_planning_session(self, initial_prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Conduct an interactive planning session with iterative refinement
    """
    # Allow multiple rounds of plan refinement
    # Support feedback incorporation
    # Enable plan versioning and comparison
```

Advanced Task Management
Your todo system needs expansion to support Claude Code’s sophisticated task coordination:
Task Delegation and Coordination
	•	Multi-Agent Orchestration: Implement actual agent spawning rather than simulation, with different specialized modes (Researcher, Architect, Code, Debug)
	•	Task Dependencies: Add support for task relationships and dependency management
	•	Resource Allocation: Track which agents are working on which tasks
Enhanced Task Metadata

```python
class EnhancedTask:
    def __init__(self):
        self.estimated_duration: Optional[int] = None
        self.actual_duration: Optional[int] = None
        self.complexity_score: int = 1
        self.required_skills: List[str] = []
        self.dependencies: List[str] = []
        self.sub_tasks: List[Dict] = []
```

Integration and Automation Features
Development Workflow Integration
Claude Code excels at integrating with development workflows. Add these capabilities:
	•	Git Integration: Implement commit message generation, branch management, and PR creation
	•	Code Analysis: Add codebase scanning and understanding capabilities
	•	File Management: Support for reading, editing, and organizing project files
	•	Testing Integration: Automated test running and result analysis
Custom Commands and Automation
Implement Claude Code’s custom command functionality:

```python
def register_custom_command(self, name: str, command_template: str, description: str):
    """
    Register custom commands for repetitive tasks like formatting, testing, deployment
    """
    pass

def execute_custom_command(self, command_name: str, context: Dict[str, Any]):
    """
    Execute registered custom commands with project context
    """
    pass
```

Workflow Orchestration
Implement the “Explore, Plan, Code, Commit” Pattern
This is Claude Code’s core workflow:

```python
def execute_development_workflow(self, project_description: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    1. Exploration phase - understand codebase and requirements
    2. Planning phase - create detailed implementation plan  
    3. Implementation phase - execute the plan
    4. Review and commit phase - validate and commit changes
    """
    pass
```

Sub-Agent Management
Replace your simulation with actual agent coordination:
	•	Parallel Execution: Support running multiple agents simultaneously
	•	Context Sharing: Enable agents to share findings and coordinate
	•	Result Synthesis: Combine outputs from multiple specialized agents
Advanced Planning Features
Thinking Budget Integration
Implement Claude Code’s thinking levels:

```python
def set_thinking_budget(self, level: str) -> None:
    """
    Support thinking levels: 'think' < 'think hard' < 'think harder' < 'ultrathink'
    """
    thinking_budgets = {
        'think': 1000,
        'think hard': 2500, 
        'think harder': 5000,
        'ultrathink': 10000
    }
```

Project Documentation Integration
Add support for centralized documentation:
	•	Auto-generated Documentation: Create project overviews, architecture diagrams, and implementation guides
	•	Markdown File Management: Integrate with `claude.markdown` style documentation files
	•	Change Tracking: Document decisions and rationale
Persistence and State Management
Your current in-memory storage needs upgrading:

```python
 class PersistentPlanningOrganization:
    def __init__(self, project_path: str):
        self.project_path = project_path
        self.state_file = os.path.join(project_path, '.claude_state.json')
        self.load_state()
    
    def save_state(self):
        """Persist todos, plans, and agent states"""
        pass
    
    def load_state(self):
        """Restore previous session state"""
        pass
```

Quality and Safety Features
Plan Safety Validation
Implement safety checks similar to Claude Code’s plan mode:
	•	Impact Assessment: Analyze potential risks of proposed changes
	•	Rollback Planning: Create automatic rollback strategies
	•	Change Scope Limiting: Prevent overly broad changes in single iterations
Progress Tracking and Metrics
Add comprehensive tracking:

```python
def track_planning_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Track planning success rates, time estimates vs actuals,
    common failure points, and optimization opportunities
    """
    pass
```

Implementation Priorities
	1.	Start with Enhanced Planning Mode: Focus on structured, interactive planning with proper validation
	2.	Add Real Agent Coordination: Replace simulation with actual multi-agent orchestration
	3.	Implement Core Workflows: Build the explore-plan-code-commit pattern
	4.	Add Development Tool Integration: Connect with Git, file systems, and testing frameworks
	5.	Build Persistence Layer: Ensure state and progress are maintained across sessions
The key to replicating Claude Code’s effectiveness is the seamless integration between planning, execution, and development workflows, combined with intelligent agent coordination that can handle complex, multi-step development tasks.
