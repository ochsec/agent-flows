# Pull Request Review

## Overview
This PR modifies the code review prompt in `review_openrouter.py` to improve accuracy and specificity of code reviews. The changes focus on ensuring more precise and verifiable feedback by adding explicit instructions and constraints.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Improvements
**File**: `workflows/claude_code/code_review/review_openrouter.py`

The PR makes positive changes to improve the prompt structure and clarity:

1. **Better Structure** (Lines 70-76):
```python
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCURACY:
1. ✅ ONLY report issues you can verify exist in the actual code shown
2. ✅ Include exact file names and line numbers from the diff
3. ✅ Quote the actual code when discussing issues
```
These explicit instructions help ensure more accurate and actionable reviews.

2. **Enhanced Detail Requirements** (Lines 104-108):
```python
For each issue found, you MUST provide:
- **Exact file name and line number** from the diff
- **Quoted code snippet** showing the actual issue
- **Severity level** (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with justification
- **Specific fix** with before/after code examples
```
The updated format enforces better documentation of issues with concrete examples.

### Minor Suggestions

1. **Consistency in Formatting** (Lines 110-114):
```python
## Overall Assessment
- Summary of **verified** findings only
- Clear recommendation based on **actual issues found**
- Priority of **confirmed** problems only
```
Consider using consistent punctuation at the end of each bullet point.
